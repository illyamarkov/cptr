Alright, you found it, I didn't exactly make it difficult.
 
You can see the structure of the website here, and all of it is open for anyone to use. If you want to use this for your personal projects, you don't even have to credit me (I wasn't the one that made the template, in fact, I couldn't find a name on this one).
 
If you have any concerns, forward them to me and I will look into them.
