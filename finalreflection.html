There is no pressure against deciding what you believe in, as religion should be something that gives you
        faith in a way comfortable to you. I also learned the amount of diversity with various different religions, and how unique the various rituals are, as well as the beliefs. Although some religious practices may have seemed unusual, I came to the
        understanding that those who practice these rituals find comfort, and as long as nobody is harmed, rituals are a great practice. I learned that religion doesnâ€™t define who you are, and shouldnâ€™t be used as a method of categorization, or external
        pressure on your life. However, I also learned that there were (and still are) those who channel their hatred towards those who follow religions that they do not support. These people treat religion as something that is used to categorize individuals
        into groups, which is simply untrue, and is a very negative way to view a concept that we are fortunate enough to have in our lives.<br><br><em>Challenge:</em><br><br>Living in the modern times with religious beliefs becomes difficult because
        of the society we live in, and the requirements that are set. It may seem like the major problem would be how commonly you find atheists, however it is actually the standard that is put upon everyone. It is seen as unusual to have faith as it
        can conflict with work, or other professional activities. Rarely someone would take time out of their day to go pray, simply because if youâ€™re committed to your work (or school) you would prioritize it over the faith you may have. Also, with upcoming
        technologies like Elon Muskâ€™s Neuralink, inevitably every individual will have a neurotransmitter, which although is convenient, most religious beliefs would be against it. Although Canada in particular is accepting of mostly all religions, other
        places in the world likely discriminate against individuals with certain beliefs.&nbsp;<br></p>
