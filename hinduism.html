Dharma is typically doing virtuous gestures towards others, and not expecting anything in return. Although it may seem unnecessary and unbeneficial
        to consider practicing this, it actually helps you grow as a person, and improves your appreciation for life. There are many different ways someone willing to practice dharma can do so, however there are certain positions that practice it as part
        of their employment. A Teacher satisfies dharma by providing the gift of education to the students, this is a valuable gift that changes the course of their lives. A parent fulfills this by providing for their children, this allows their children
        to survive, and possibly thrive in the future. A friend would be there for you, and with this practice they would support you. A police officer would maintain the integrity of their career by protecting others, as well as avoiding harm to those
        who are innocent. Your dharma is from which actions you do that are kind, whether that would be as big as creating a charity organization, or as small as throwing out some litter. Any effort contributes towards your dharma, and these positive
        activities are highly encouraged.<br><br><br></p><img data-aos="zoom-in" src="assets/img/Hinduism.png" style="width: 56px;margin-top: -52px;"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary" role="button" data-bs-hover-animate="swing" style="color: #ffffff;opacity: 1;outline-color: #fff;margin-right: 0;margin-left: 4vw;"
