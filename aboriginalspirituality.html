In Aboriginal Spirituality culture, nature is seen as sacred, and treated as such. Life is treated with respect, even if it is a complex animal, or a simple
        herb. In today's society, we take nature for granted. This is already causing pressing issues, imagine how devastating the effects of our actions will be in the future. We should follow the example of Aboriginal Spirituality in regards to the
        efforts towards preserving our earth, and respecting the life that inhabits it. Although most practices performed towards nature in Aboriginal culture would categorize as spiritual, they don't have to be. To support the preservation of our natural
        land, we could promote the use of renewable resources, and practice avoiding pollutants. We could also reinforce the efforts we put in to prevent the mass extinction of animal species, like emergency dispatch to forign land in the case of a lethal
        forest fire. This will prolong the time we spend on earth significantly, and benefit us as a civilization. Although theorizing about this concept is interesting, I suggest actually implementing these changes. To promote this beneficial activity,
        it may be necessary to implement laws against producing large amounts of carbon dioxide, and reason for a movement that would place fines on surpassing these restrictions. Also, it would be of interest to form a licenced international dispatch
        group as part of effort to prevent forest fires, and invest more time in ensuring that endangered species never go extinct.<br><br><br></p><img data-aos="zoom-in" src="assets/img/AborginalSpiritualityCharacter.png" style="width: 87px;margin-top: -52px;"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary"
