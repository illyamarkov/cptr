Although the days which are designated for cultural activities are present, there are some arguments as to which would be present on the calendar. These arguments are typically instigated by those
        who follow a much less popular religion, and therefore not receiving the same treatment that a much larger religion receives. Iâ€™m proposing a solution to this issue. I support diversity, and I believe that we should be inclusive of all religions.
        Although we can simply include all holidays amongst all religions, there could be a situation of exploitation, and also discrimation based on how many days someone may allocate to holidays. So, the solution would be to designate a specific amount
        of days to everyone, and those days could be used as the individual decides. Everyone will be given the same amount of days, and could use them as they please. Certain rules would be set in place, like the prohibition of using the days during
        certain portions of the year. Or using a certain amount of days in a row. There could also be preset recommendations for certain religions you could simply choose, or a custom distribution for you to decide. This would allow the inclusion of every
        religion, with the exception of those that practice an unusually large amount of dedicated traditions.<br><br><br></p><img data-aos="zoom-in" src="assets/img/Christianity.png" style="width: 50px;margin-top: -52px;"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary" role="button"
